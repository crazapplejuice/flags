# Flags Project

See the [Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to 
use git and Github to interact with this project.  

1. Submit your name and a fact about you into the "biographies" folder.  
The name of the file with your information should be formatted as: 
`lastname_firstname.txt`.  

2. Open the `Flags.ipynb` notebook.  There is a sample flag there, created 
using the `ipythonblocks` package (included in this repository).  Create 
your own flag, re-saving the notebook as `countryname_yourlastname.ipynb` 
in the `flags` directory.  Submit to this repository.  

> Thanks to Matt Davis `@jiffyclub` for developing [ipythonblocks](http://ipythonblocks.org).
